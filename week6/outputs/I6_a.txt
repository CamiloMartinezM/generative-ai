To guide the avatar to the goal, we need to consider its starting position and orientation, the grid layout, and then devise a sequence of valid actions. Let's break down the grid first:

### Initial Grid Layout:
- The avatar starts at position (0,0) facing East (`>`).
- The goal (`+`) is located at (2,2).

### Navigation Steps:

1. **Start at (0,0) facing East (`>`)**:
   - **move_forward**: Move to (0,1).

2. **At (0,1) facing East (`>`)**:
   - **move_forward**: Move to (0,2).

3. **At (0,2) facing East (`>`)**:
   - **turn_right**: Change direction to South (`v`).

4. **At (0,2) facing South (`v`)**:
   - **move_forward**: Move to (1,2).

5. **At (1,2) facing South (`v`)**:
   - **move_forward**: Move to (2,2).

Now the avatar has reached the goal positioned at (2,2).

### Final Sequence of Moves:
- move_forward
- move_forward
- turn_right
- move_forward
- move_forward

These steps guide the avatar from the starting point to the goal without hitting any walls.
