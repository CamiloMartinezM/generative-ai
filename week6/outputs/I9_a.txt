To create the 4x4 ASCII grid based on the given elements, we will place the avatar, goal, and walls into the grid. Hereâ€™s the setup:

1. **Avatar**: Starts at coordinates `(0,0)` and is facing East, represented by `>`.
2. **Goal**: Located at coordinates `(2,2)`, represented by `+`.
3. **Walls**: Located at the specified coordinates and represented by `#`.

Let's plot these on the grid:

```
> . . #
. # . #
. . + #
# # # #
```

- The avatar `>` is at `(0,0)`.
- The goal `+` is at `(2,2)`.
- Walls `#` are placed at the following coordinates:
  - `(0,3)`
  - `(1,1)`
  - `(1,3)`
  - `(2,3)`
  - `(3,0)`
  - `(3,1)`
  - `(3,2)`
  - `(3,3)`
