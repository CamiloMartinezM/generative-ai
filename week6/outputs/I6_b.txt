To guide the avatar towards the goal in the given grid, we need to carefully determine the sequence of actions that will navigate from the starting position to the goal while avoiding walls. Let's break down the grid and implement the sequence of actions.

### Initial Setup

- **Avatar Initial Position**: Start at `(0,0)` facing East (`>`).
- **Goal Position**: Located at `(2,2)` with the symbol `+`.

### Grid Analysis

We can visualize the grid with indexes to simplify movement:

```
(0,0) >  (0,1) .   (0,2) .   (0,3) #
(1,0) .  (1,1) #   (1,2) .   (1,3) #
(2,0) .  (2,1) .   (2,2) +   (2,3) #
(3,0) #  (3,1) #   (3,2) #   (3,3) #
```

### Strategy

1. Move from `(0,0)` facing East to `(0,2)`.
2. Navigate down towards the goal while avoiding walls.

### Sequence of Moves

1. **move_forward**: Now at `(0,1)`, still facing East.
2. **move_forward**: Now at `(0,2)`, still facing East.
3. **turn_right**: Now facing South (`v`).
4. **move_forward**: Now at `(1,2)`, still facing South.
5. **move_forward**: Now at `(2,2)`, reached the goal.

By following these actions, the avatar successfully reaches the goal `(2,2)`:

- Initial Position: `(0,0) facing (>)`
  - 1. `move_forward` => `(0,1) facing (>)`
  - 2. `move_forward` => `(0,2) facing (>)`
  - 3. `turn_right` => `(0,2) facing (v)`
  - 4. `move_forward` => `(1,2) facing (v)`
  - 5. `move_forward` => `(2,2) facing (v)` (Goal Reached)

This sequence will guide the avatar to the goal without any collisions.
