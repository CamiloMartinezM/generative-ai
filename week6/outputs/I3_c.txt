To extract the elements from the provided grid, we will map each character to its corresponding element and location:

1. **Avatar**: The avatar is positioned at the start of the grid with the symbol `>`, which means it is facing East. It is located at the first row, first column.

2. **Goal**: The goal is represented by the `+` symbol, located at the third row, third column.

3. **Walls**: Walls are represented by the `#` symbol. The positions of walls are as follows: 

   - First row, fourth column (0:3)
   - Second row, second column (1:1)
   - Second row, fourth column (1:3)
   - Third row, fourth column (2:3)
   - Fourth row, first column (3:0)
   - Fourth row, second column (3:1)
   - Fourth row, third column (3:2)
   - Fourth row, fourth column (3:3)

Now, we list these elements according to the required format:

- avatar: 0:0:east
- goal: 2:2
- walls: [0:3, 1:1, 1:3, 2:3, 3:0, 3:1, 3:2, 3:3]
