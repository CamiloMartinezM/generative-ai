To guide the avatar to the goal, we need to carefully navigate the grid while avoiding walls. Below is a step-by-step sequence of moves starting from the initial position and facing direction:

### Current State:
- **Starting Position**: (0, 0)
- **Facing Direction**: East (`>`)

### Grid:
```
>	.	.	#
.	#	.	#
.	.	+	#
#	#	#	#
```

### Goal Position:
- **Position**: (2, 2)
- Avoid **colliding** with walls (`#`).

### Move Sequence:
1. **move_forward**: Move from (0, 0) to (0, 1).
2. **move_forward**: Move from (0, 1) to (0, 2).
3. **turn_right**: Change facing direction from East (`>`) to South (`v`).
4. **move_forward**: Move from (0, 2) to (1, 2).
5. **move_forward**: Move from (1, 2) to (2, 2). [Goal reached]

### Explanation:
- Starting at (0, 0) facing East, we move two cells to the right into an open path until reaching (0, 2).
- At (0, 2), we turn right to face South, aligning with the path leading downwards.
- We then move forward two times to reach (2, 2), which is the goal.

You complete the task successfully by reaching the goal (`+`) without colliding with walls.
