\section{Exercise Assignment: E1}\label{sec:e1}

We compute \(\mathcal{X}_i\) for each position \(i \in \mathcal{I}\) by selecting the \(k = 2\) tokens with the largest negative gradient \(-\nabla_{x_i} \mathcal{L}(y^*_{i,k}; x_{1:n})\), as shown by Algorithm \ref{alg:greedy_coordinate_gradient}'s step 3, i.e., $\mathcal{X}_i \gets \text{Top-}k(-\nabla_{x_i} \mathcal{L}(x_{1:n}))$.

\begin{algorithm}[H]

    \Repeat{$T$ times}{
        \For{$i \in \mathcal{I}$}{
            $\mathcal{X}_i \gets \text{Top-}k(-\nabla_{x_i} \mathcal{L}(x_{1:n}))$ \tcp*[r]{Compute top-$k$ promising token substitutions}
        }
        \For{$b = 1, \dots, B$}{
            $\tilde{x}_{1:n}^{(b)} \gets x_{1:n}$ \tcp*[r]{Initialize element of batch} 
            $\tilde{x}_i^{(b)} \gets \text{Uniform}(\mathcal{X}_i), \text{where } i = \text{Uniform}(\mathcal{I})$ \tcp*[r]{Select random replacement token}
        }
        $x_{1:n} \gets \tilde{x}_{1:n}^{(b^\star)}, \text{where } b^\star = \text{arg}\min_b \mathcal{L}(\tilde{x}_{1:n}^{(b)})$ \tcp*[r]{Compute best replacement}
    }
    \Output{ Optimized prompt $x_{1:n}$}
\end{algorithm}

From Table \ref{tab:gradients}, we have the following gradients for each token \(t_0, t_1, t_2\) at positions \(m+1, m+2, m+3\):
\begin{itemize}
    \item For \(i = m+1\): Tokens \(t_0, t_1, t_2\) have gradients $3, 0, -1$ respectively. Thus,
    \[
        \mathcal{X}_{m+1} = \text{Top-}2(\{3, 0, -1\}) = \{t_0, t_1\}
    \]
    \item For \(i = m+2\): Tokens \(t_0, t_1, t_2\) have gradients $-3, 1, 5$ respectively. Thus,
    \[
        \mathcal{X}_{m+2} = \text{Top-}2(\{-3, 1, 5\}) = \{t_2, t_1\}
    \]
    \item For \(i = m+3\):  Tokens \(t_0, t_1, t_2\) have gradients $-3, -6, 1$ respectively. Thus,
    \[
        \mathcal{X}_{m+3} = \text{Top-}2(\{-3, -6, 1\}) = \{t_2, t_0\}
    \]
\end{itemize}

\section{Exercise Assignment: E2}\label{sec:e2}
The resulting candidate suffixes are formed by replacing the tokens at positions \(m+1, m+2, m+3\) with the sampled replacements. Since the adversarial suffix is initialized to $x_{m+1:n} = t_0 t_0 t_0$, the candidate suffixes are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(t_0t_0t_0\) from $\tilde{x}_{m+1}^{(1)} = t_0$
    \item \(t_0t_2t_0\) from $\tilde{x}_{m+2}^{(2)} = t_2$
    \item \(t_0t_2t_2\) from $\tilde{x}_{m+3}^{(3)} = t_0, \tilde{x}_{m+3}^{(4)} = t_2$
\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise Assignment: E3}\label{sec:e3}
From Table \ref{tab:loss}, we evaluate the loss \(\mathcal{L}\) for the candidates:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \(x_{m+1:n} = t_0t_0t_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(y^*_{i,k}; x_{1:n}) = -5\)
    \item \(x_{m+1:n} = t_0t_2t_0 \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(y^*_{i,k}; x_{1:n}) = -4\)
    \item \(x_{m+1:n} = t_0t_2t_2 \rightarrow \mathcal{L}(y^*_{i,k}; x_{1:n}) = -5\) (tie with \(t_0t_0t_0\))
\end{enumerate}

The suffix minimizing the loss is \(t_0t_0t_0\) or \(t_0t_2t_2\) (tie at \(-5\)).Thus, the resulting suffix can be either of these two.

\textbf{Is this the best replacement?} Yes, it achieves the lowest loss for the sampled candidates.

\textbf{Is this the best overall suffix?} No. We can see on Table \ref{tab:loss} that the suffix \(t_2t_0t_2\) has a lower loss of \(-10\), which was not sampled.

\section{Exercise Assignment: E4}\label{sec:e4}
The GCG Algorithm \ref{alg:greedy_coordinate_gradient} proceeds as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Gradient Computation}:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item The gradient \(\nabla_{e_{x_i}} \mathcal{L}(x_{1:n})\) is computed for all token positions \(i \in \mathcal{I}\), where \(e_{x_i}\) is the one-hot representation of token \(x_i\). This allows the selection of the top-\(k\) candidate replacements for each position.
        \item Computing these gradients requires \textit{one backward pass}, preceded by a \textit{single forward pass}.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Candidate Selection}: From the gradients, the Top-\(k\) replacements are identified for each position \(x_i\). This step does not involve additional forward or backward passes.
    \item \textbf{Evaluating \(B\) Replacements}: After selecting \(B\) replacements from the top-\(k\) candidates, the exact loss for each candidate replacement is evaluated via \(B\) forward passes. Nevertheless, it is important to note that:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Actually, since we are using batches of size \(B\), we can evaluate all \(B\) replacements in parallel with a single forward pass. This can be checked with the code of the official repository \href{https://github.com/llm-attacks/llm-attacks/tree/main}{llm-attacks} of the paper \cite{zou2023universaltransferableadversarialattacks}. In \texttt{llm\_attacks/minimal\_gcg/opt\_utils.py}, we can see that the function \texttt{token\_gradients()} computes the gradients for all tokens in parallel (as confirmed by the hint). Then, the function \texttt{get\_logits()} computes the logits for all tokens, making a call to \texttt{forward()}, in which the \texttt{for-loop} iterates over each batch of size $B$ (\texttt{batch\_size} in the code) and a single forward call is made \texttt{model(input\_ids=batch\_input\_ids, ...)}, where \texttt{batch\_input\_ids = input\_ids[i:i+batch\_size]}. This is also confirmed the section \textitbf{Running the attack} of their \href{https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1dinZSyP1E4KokSLPcCh1JQFUFsN-WV--?usp=sharing#scrollTo=26abc77f}{\texttt{Demo.ipynb}} of the GCG algorithm.
        \item $B$ forward passes were considered instead of $1$, as explained above, for the sake of the assignment and the fact that the following exercises provide $B$ as information, suggesting that we needed to consider it.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Token Replacement}: The token substitution that minimizes the loss is chosen, completing one iteration of the algorithm.
\end{enumerate}

Thus, the number of forward and backward passes required in one iteration of the GCG algorithm is:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backward Passes}: \(1\)
    \item \textbf{Forward Passes}: \(1 + B\)
\end{itemize}
And for $k$ iterations, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Backward Passes}: \(k\)
    \item \textbf{Forward Passes}: \((1 + B) \cdot k\)
\end{itemize}
Of course, this is considering one batch of size $B$. If we consider $m$ batches of size $B$, the number of forward passes plus the backward passes would then be 
\begin{equation}\label{eq:gcg-passes}
    (1 + B \cdot m) \cdot k + k = (2 + B \cdot m) \cdot k, \quad \text{where } m = \lceil |\mathcal{I}| \cdot |V| / B \rceil
\end{equation}
since the backward passes remain unaffected, as the computation of gradients still requires only one backward pass per iteration and, in the na√Øve approach of performing \(B\) independent forward passes for each batch (instead of a single forward pass for \(B\) elements as explained in the note on \textbf{Evaluating $B$ Replacements}), we now require $1 + B \cdot m$ forward passes per iteration. The first forward pass is for gradient computation, and the \(B \cdot m\) additional passes are for evaluating the losses of all \(B\) elements in each of the \(m\) batches. If we considered the note, Eq. \eqref{eq:gcg-passes} would be reduced to $(2 + B) \cdot k$.

\section{Exercise Assignment: E5}\label{sec:e5}
For exhaustive search, we compute all possible suffix combinations and evaluate their loss. We only need the backward passes to get the candidates, so for this case we need $0$ backward passes. On the other hand, to evaluate the loss, we do need forward passes, namely, one forward pass per suffix, that is:
\[
    |V|^{|\mathcal{I}|} = 3^{n-m} = 3^3 = 27
\]

\section{Exercise Assignment: E6}\label{sec:e6}
For \( |V| = 3, |\mathcal{I}| = 3\), 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GCG}: We have $k = 250, B = 4$, replacing the values in Eq. \eqref{eq:gcg-passes}:
    \[
        \left(2 + 4 \cdot \lceil 3 \cdot 3 / 4 \rceil\right) \cdot 250 = 3500
    \]
    In terms of quality, GCG provides a good approximation, but does not guarantee finding a global minimum.
    \item \textbf{Exhaustive search}: Total passes is \(27\), as calculated in Exercise E\ref{sec:e5}. In terms of quality, it guarantees a global minimum loss.
\end{itemize}
Therefore, I would prefer exhaustive search in this case, as the vocabulary and suffix space are small, making it computationally cheaper while guaranteeing the best result.

\section{Exercise Assignment: E7}\label{sec:e7}
For \( |V| = 50000, |\mathcal{I}| = 9 \),
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{GCG}: We have $k = 250, B = 256$, replacing the values in Eq. \eqref{eq:gcg-passes}:
    \[
        \left(2 + 256 \cdot \lceil 9 \cdot 50000 / 256 \rceil\right) \cdot 250 = 112512500
    \]
    If we considered the note on \textbf{Evaluating $B$ Replacements}, the total passes would be $(2 + 256) \cdot 250 = 64500$.
    \item \textbf{Exhaustive search}: Total passes is \(50000^9 \approx 2^{42}\), infeasible.
\end{itemize}

Therefore, I would prefer GCG, as exhaustive search is computationally infeasible for large vocabulary and suffix lengths, whereas GCG provides a good approximation with a reasonable number of passes.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Exercise Assignment: I1}
Human-generated red-teaming prompts achieve a relatively low success rate but have the highest diversity among all approaches. This suggests that while human creativity allows for a wide variety of prompts, they are less likely to find ones that successfully elicit harmful behavior.

\begin{arrowlist}
    \item Success Rate: $0.03515625$
    \item Diversity: $0.8449155224355859$
\end{arrowlist}

\section{Exercise Assignment: I2}
The success rate is significantly lower than that of manual red-teaming.
Diversity is slightly reduced compared to manual red-teaming but still remains relatively high. One can conclude that zero-shot red-teaming is less effective than manual in both generating harmful behavior and exploring a diverse range of prompts.

\begin{arrowlist}
    \item Success Rate: $0.00390625$
    \item Diversity: $0.8028542245988661$
\end{arrowlist}


\section{Exercise Assignment: I3}
Success rate is much higher than both manual and zero-shot methods, indicating that including examples of successful zero-shot prompts significantly boosts the effectiveness of the attack. Diversity is slightly reduced compared to the manual and zero-shot approaches. Thus, few-shot red-teaming strikes a good balance, achieving high success rates while maintaining moderate diversity.

\begin{arrowlist}
    \item Success Rate: $0.11328125$
    \item Diversity: $0.7829875590753036$
\end{arrowlist}

\section{Exercise Assignment: I4}
The success rate is on par with zero-shot but far lower than manual and few-shot methods. The diversity is the lowest among all approaches, likely due to overly optimizing for specific prompts, reducing exploration of diverse behaviors, and leading to the lowest diversity.

\begin{arrowlist}
    \item Success Rate: $0.00390625$
    \item Diversity: $0.5110306002011656$
\end{arrowlist}
