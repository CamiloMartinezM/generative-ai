Emily was not just any ordinary villager; she was an aspiring software developer with a knack for solving complex problems. Her latest challenge was to create a sorting function that could organize a list of people by their ages. The function needed to place older individuals at the front of the list.\n\nEmily knew that most sorting algorithms required comparing elements, and she wanted to ensure that her function was efficient. She decided to use the concept of merge sort, which she had learned in her computer science class. This algorithm divides the list into smaller sublists, sorts them, and then merges them back together, ensuring a sorted list is produced.\n\nEmily began with her merge sort function, which looked like this:\n\n```python\ndef merge(left, right):\n    new_list = []\n    while left and right:\n        if left[0][1] > right[0][1]:\n            new_list.append(left.pop(0))\n        else:\n            new_list.append(right.pop(0))\n    new_list.extend(left if left else right)\n    return new_list\n\ndef merge_sort(lst):\n    if len(lst) < 2:\n        return lst\n    mid = len(lst) // 2\n    left = merge_sort(lst[:mid])\n    right = merge_sort(lst[mid:])\n    return merge(left, right)\n\ndef sort_age(lst):\n    return merge_sort(lst)\n```\n\nEmily had a few villagers who volunteered to be part of her test case. She called the function `sort_age` with a list containing tuples of a person's gender and age, which looked like this: `[('M', 23), ('F', 19), ('M', 30)]`.\n\nWhen she ran her function, she was delighted to see that the output matched the expected result: `[('M', 30), ('M', 23), ('F', 19)]`. The function had successfully sorted the list to place the older villagers at the front, just as she wanted.\n\nEmily shared her function with the village elders, who were impressed by her problem-solving skills. They praised her for her contributions and encouraged her to keep practicing and refining her abilities.\n\nFrom that day on, Emily became known as the 'Sorting Wizard' of the village. Her story served as an inspiration for many other young villagers, who also started to pursue their passion for programming, hoping to become as skilled as Emily. And thus, the spirit of learning and innovation spread throughout the village, all thanks to the determination and talent of a young girl named Emily."
