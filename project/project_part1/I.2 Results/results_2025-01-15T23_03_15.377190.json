            "hint": "The return statement in the final line should return `len(seq)` instead of `i + 1` to correctly handle the case when `x` is greater than all elements in `seq`."

            "hint": "The loop should iterate until the end of the sequence, but the return statements are incorrectly positioned, which may cause premature exits before checking all elements."

            "hint": "The return statement inside the loop incorrectly returns the length of the sequence if the first element is less than x, causing the function to terminate prematurely; it should only return the index of the first element greater than or equal to x."

            "hint": "The loop should iterate through the entire length of the sequence, not stopping one element early, and you need to handle the case where x is greater than the last element separately."

            "hint": "In the `unique_day` and `unique_month` functions, the comparison should check for exactly one occurrence, but you are returning `count >= 2` instead of `count == 1`, and you also need to initialize the `count` variable correctly in `unique_month` and `contains_unique_day`."

            "hint": "In the `unique_day` function, you should return `False` if the length of `result` is greater than 1 or if it is 0, and also ensure that the day comparison is done correctly for the type of `day`."

            "hint": "You are appending the oldest person to the final list inside the loop, which causes duplicates and incorrect order; instead, find the oldest person outside the loop and append only once before removing them from the list."

            "hint": "The code incorrectly assumes that elements in `lst` are subscriptable (i.e., it uses `i[1]`), which causes an error since the elements are integers, not tuples or lists."
