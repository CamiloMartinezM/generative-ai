        "problem_1_prog_2": {
            "hint": "Consider starting your loop from index 0 and carefully check all elements against x, particularly handling cases where the searched value matches an existing value."
        },
        "problem_1_prog_3": {
            "hint": "Consider the placement of your return statements inside the loop, as returning too early prevents the function from checking all elements."

            "hint": "Consider revising the condition that checks if the sequence is empty, as it currently does not function properly."

            "hint": "Consider how you handle the case where \\( x \\) is greater than the last element of the sequence; your current implementation doesn't account for it properly."

            "hint": "Consider checking if you're using the correct variable name for the parameter in the `unique_day` function, as it's key to counting occurrences accurately."

            "hint": "Consider changing the return condition in both `unique_day` and `unique_month` functions to check for equality with 1 instead of greater than 1."
        },
        "problem_2_prog_3": {
            "hint": "Consider how you are checking the count of occurrences; ensure you return `True` for exactly one occurrence rather than two or more."
        },
        "problem_2_prog_4": {
            "hint": "Consider how the logic in your `unique_day` function needs to accurately count occurrences of a day to determine if it is unique."

            "hint": "Consider revising the `contains_unique_day` function to append only the day values to `days_in_month` instead of the full tuples."
        },
        "problem_3_prog_1": {
            "hint": "Consider using a set instead of a tuple for storing occurrences, as sets provide the functionality you need to track elements dynamically."

        "problem_3_prog_2": {
            "hint": "Consider how you are currently checking for duplicates in your code and whether this aligns with the goal of creating a new list that preserves order while eliminating extras."

        "problem_4_prog_1": {
            "hint": "Consider how the list of people is being modified during the sorting process, as this may interfere with the correct order of elements being processed."
        },
        "problem_4_prog_2": {
            "hint": "Consider how the return value of the `sort()` method affects the output of your function."

        "problem_4_prog_3": {
            "hint": "Consider how you are comparing the elements in your tuples, as you should only compare the age values."

            "hint": "Consider how the conditions for your while loop should reflect the variables being passed to your merge function."

            "hint": "Consider where you place the `final.append(old)` line in your loop, as it currently may result in adding multiple copies of the same tuple to the final list."
        },
        "problem_5_prog_1": {
            "hint": "Consider changing the loop condition so that it ensures you only attempt to gather k elements rather than allowing for non-positive values of k."
        },
        "problem_5_prog_2": {
            "hint": "Consider reviewing how you're comparing elements in your original code to fix the indexing error."
        },
        "problem_5_prog_3": {
            "hint": "Consider revisiting your while loop condition to ensure it correctly checks the length of the result list rather than the input list."

        "problem_5_prog_4": {
            "hint": "Consider how removing elements from the list while iterating through it can lead to unexpected behavior and how it might be better to find the largest element first before removal."
        },

            "hint": "Consider how you can define your iteration variable correctly and ensure you're using it properly to find the top k values."
