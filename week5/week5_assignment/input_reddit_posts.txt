TITLE: Decisions regarding a 401k Cash out
POST: Hi r/personal finance,
I have been looking for guidance on this issue, but do not have a financial planner currently. I am a 26 year old male looking to leave my current job. To bring you up to pace, I am an insurance adjuster for a major insurance company in America. I took a promotion about 9-10 months ago that I am now regretting. Without getting into any details on why I am looking outside the company, I have a financial dilemma that may not allow me to leave at this time. I currently make about $46,700. I currently have no savings to my name due to some financial hardships over the past few months. I have been contributing to a 401k for 2 years now (6% by me, 6% company match). There was a part in time that I was only giving 5% but my company still matched. Anyhow, I have about $7,700 in my 401k with Fidelity. I know their fee is typically 10% early withdrawal + a 20% withholding to the IRS. I have applications out to about 7 other positions that I feel confident match my skill set. In the mean time, if I wanted to quit my job currently, would it be a poor decision to cash out my 401k to make an emergency fund? From my calculations, the amount I would receive would be enough to cover at least 3 month living expenses plus I have at least another pay check coming.

TITLE: Race Report: First Marathon!
POST: Hey /R/unnit,
Just wanted to follow up and post a race report for the Yellowknife Overlander Marathon (which was my first ever marathon) that I finished today! After running my first half 6 weeks ago and getting 3 weeks of training before my taper I was woefully underprepared but I set out only to finish. My final time was 4 hours and 20 something minutes, I sadly was so caught up in the moment that I didn't take a look at the clock but I will get my results in the next week. I woke up at 5 AM today and had my usual long run breakfast of a bagel + energy drink. The weather was between 10-20 celsius, gradually warming up as the time ticked on, but very bearable with the overcast and wind. Miles 1-13: Fairly uneventful and basically was just warming up at a 10 minute pace or slower, minor irritants like my foot getting a pinch on every step (nothing painful I could just feel it) and my stomach being grumbly. MIles 13-20: At this point I was starting to feel a bit of fatigue as the miles started to pile on. Around mile 13.5 I got a major cramp in my foot and I had to retie my shoe way tighter which alleviated the issue for the most part. At mile 16 I had to use the washroom really bad and was lucky to snag a toilet out on the route (these were spread out very few and far between) which saved my ass when I felt I was going to burst.
20-24: At this point I felt I had good energy but the wear and tear on my muscles was reaching new levels. Hips, my left knee, my feet, my nips, hamstring were all seizing up and it was some of the most mentally challenging parts of the race.
24-26: Flat ground and smooth sailing, I was sort of hobbling to make it back but I never walked once!
post 26: I am in bed and everything hurts, theres nothing that isn't aching and I want ice cream...

TITLE: How can I mange this Job
POST: I Work at this small Polish restaurant, when I was first employed i was a dish washer, then I got promoted to bus boy and then almost waiter but then that failed. Our dishwasher recently quit to go to college and I am not stuck with doing the dishes 3~4 times a week. This is not your normal dishes. I have to do dishes, easy,Prep food, and that's all I did when I first started to work there but now I clean the grease hood, wipe down every surface and do all the busboy jobs as well every night. I'm only 15 and it I end up leaving work around 1:00 a.m. in the morning every school night. How can I help myself get through all the work?

TITLE: 27 yr old planning on getting an apartment in July with my 20 yr d brother. How do I plan so We don't have to struggle?
POST: Due to circumstances I have to live on my own, living with parents is out of the question and my little brother wants to get out as well. I am renting a room for $400 dollars a month until July and then I am on my own. I live in NJ and we want to move to Philadelphia as we are very close. I will be able to commute to work but plan on keeping an eye out in the city. My brother makes 8.75 working around 30 hours a week. I make 13 an hour working 40 hours a week and sometimes over time which is time an a half. After taxes I make 804 every other week. I am in debt 11,000 but have been making monthly payments and will be getting a credit card this Friday to build my credit and also have something for emergencies. My question is, is this doable? I will have to pay 80$ for tolls if I move to Philadelphia which will be an added expense. I am not sure if it is worth it. My current bills excluding my rent are as follows.
75 phone
91 car insurance
50 towards debts
30 misc Netflix ect.
I am thinking 800 a month is doable, I also know we will have utilities.

TITLE: Is there a good solution to all the mass amount of usernames and passwords I need to remember for every website?
POST: I'm sure I'm not the only one that has this problem. I have nearly 100 active accounts between forums, social media, email, financial institutions, and whatever. Some assign you a username others allow you to pick. Some require different lengths. Then you have the password problem: remember when you could have lengths less than 6 characters? I still have some of those passwords. Alphanumberic only? Special characters mandatory? Its insane. As of right now, I have a txt file with all my websites, the username, and password I used. This works kinda okay, but then I have multiple computers so I have to maintain the file in 3 locations? Sure, you can "always remember" but that doesn't work on my banking, phone, and utilities sites. Oh, and getting a new computer? Enter everything all over again (if you remember your username/password). On top of that, I'm a developer, so I end up using multiple browsers (sure, I have a favorite that I use more often than the others, but that doesn't mean I don't use 2-3 different browsers per computer). To preempt any doucher that says "I only have a facebook, gmail, and reddit account, that's all I need and that's all you should need." Don't fucking bother. I'm here looking for a solution, not listen to some dickface pat himself on the back about something so trivial. I have a social/entertainment side, a finance/professional side, and a developer/hobby side that I'm trying really hard to keep separate (for security AND professionalism) so I'm going to need facebook and reddit and several developer forums and youtube and three financial institutions and multiple email addresses (for each version of me) and lets not forget about every place I buy something from online... I need an account for all of them too.
